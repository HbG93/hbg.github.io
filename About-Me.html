    <div class="center">It all started in 1993 when I was born at Bodø hospital which is a city in the north of Norway. I however didn’t grow up in the city but a more rural part - Meløy. It’s not a big municipality but it’s enough for me. 
        Despite what my local surroundings might suggest I am much more of a homebody. I like spending most of my time on the computer either doing things alone or with my friends. It could be anything from listening to music, watching videos and films, playing games or finding a topic to learn about. 
        When not spending my time on the computer I enjoy fishing, kicking a ball, going for walks around in nature or spending in person time with friends and family. Below is a picture of my living rooms view.
